                This daisy chain stitch variation makes individual flowers connected by two petals in the middle.
                 This daisy chain uses six petal beads per stitch. It doesn't take any special materials other 
                 than a needle, thread, and beads. Almost any bead size and type can be used, as the number 
                 of daisy petals can be adjusted to fit around whichever size bead you're using for the daisy centers.
